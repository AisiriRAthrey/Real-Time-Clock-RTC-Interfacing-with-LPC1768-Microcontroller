# Real-Time-Clock-RTC-Interfacing-with-LPC1768-Microcontroller
This repository contains a C program to interface a Real-Time Clock (RTC) with the LPC1768 microcontroller. The project demonstrates how to use I2C communication for real-time date and time tracking, and displays the results on an LCD.

## üöÄ Features
 <br> 1. Accurate timekeeping using the RTC module of LPC1768 <br> I2C communication setup for RTC interfacing.
   <br>2. Functions for setting and reading date and time.
   <br>3. LCD display integration for real-time date and time output.
   <br>4. Low power consumption mode for efficient timekeeping.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements
   <br>1. LPC1768 Microcontroller Board
   <br>2. RTC Module (DS1307/DS3231 or equivalent)
   <br>3. 16x2 LCD Display
   <br>4. I2C Bus (SDA, SCL connections)
   <br>5. Connecting Wires and Breadboard
   <br>6. Power Supply (3.3V/5V)

## üíª Software Requirements
   <br>1 .Keil uVision IDE (for C programming and debugging)
   <br>2. NXP LPC1768 CMSIS Library (for register definitions)
   <br>3. Serial Terminal (optional) for debugging (e.g., PuTTY)
